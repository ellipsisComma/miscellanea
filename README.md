# Miscellanea

This is (intended to be) a collection of miscellaneous mid-sized code snippets, thought experiments, and &ldquo;how do I do [X slightly-complex thing]&rdquo; tests. They should all work correctly, but probably shouldn't be used in production (there are undoubtedly better ways to do any of them).
